  "3799": "Faith adheres to all the articles of faith by reason of one medium: the First Truth proposed to us in Scriptures, according to the teaching of the Church who well understands them. Whoever abandons this medium is altogether lacking in faith (ST 2-2.5.3.ad2).",

  "3821": "2) the execution of the design. ",
  "3822": "As to 1) the design of government, God governs all things immediately; whereas in 2) its execution, He governs some things by means of others.",
  "3824": ""Person" signifies what is most perfect in all nature: that which subsists in a rational nature. ",

  "3867": "Because the company of the faithful is gathered out of both sexes, the Holy Church is described as being like ten virgins, where just as bad are mixed with good, and reprobate with elect, there is a mixture of wise and foolish virgins (Golden Chain, Gospel of Matthew).",
  "3869": "The priest in extending his arms signifies the outstretching of Christ's arms upon the cross. He also lifts up his hands as he prays, to point out that his prayer is directed to God for the people, according to Lam. 3:41: "Let us lift up our hearts with our hands" (ST 3.83.5ad5).",

  "3885": "What is sought in prayer is sometimes not a true, but an apparent, good; simply put, it is an evil. So such a prayer is not capable of being granted by God. Hence, it is said in James (4:3): 'You ask and you receive not, because you ask amiss' (ScG 3.96).",

  "3925": "The end of faith, even as of the other virtues, must be referred to the end of charity, which is the love of God and our neighbor.",

  "3976": "3) the ultimate end of our sanctification, which is eternal life (ST 3.60.3).",
  "3978": "The devils cannot by their intellect perceive Christ in this sacrament, except through faith, to which they do not willingly assent, yet they are convinced of it from the evidence of signs, according to James 2:19: "The devils believe, and tremble" (ST 3.76.7).",

  "3988": "Sacred Scripture does not present divine things to us under sensible images so that our intellect may stop with them, but that it may rise from them to the immaterial world (DT 6.2ad1).",
  "3990": "Christ loved us effectively, which is obvious from his works, for the proof of love is shown from works. The best thing man can do for a friend is to give himself for that friend. This is what Christ did: "Christ loved us and gave himself up for us" (Eph 5:2)(In Jn. 13, lect. 7).",

  "4008": "It is impossible for an effect to be stronger than its cause, and every hatred arises from some love as its cause. So it is impossible for hatred to be stronger than love absolutely (ST 1-2.29.3).",

  "4040": "The sum total of Christian religion, as regards external works, consists in mercy. Even so, the inward love of charity, whereby we are united to God, outweighs both love and mercy for our neighbor (ST 2-2.30.4ad2).",

  "4078": "To show Christ's excellence, the Apostle says that He was anointed w/ the oil of gladness. For He is a king: 'Behold the king shall reign in justice' (Is. 32:1); 'For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, and he shall save us' (Is. 33:32) (Commentary on Hebrews 1:8-9).",

  "4148": "Love in us is something that abides in the lover, and the word of the heart is something abiding in the speaker yet w/ a relation to the thing expressed by word, or loved. But in God in whom nothing is accidental there is more than this, because both Word and Love are subsistent.",

  "5360": "The Lord and riches are contrary masters; therefore, you cannot serve God and mammon. But note that it is one thing to have riches as a master and another as a servant." For he has riches as a master who uses them well and acquires fruit from them; but a servant of riches is one who receives no fruit from them: "There is another evil which I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt" (Ec 5:13).",
  "5362": ""No man can serve two masters."
